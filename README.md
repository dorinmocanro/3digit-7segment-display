# 3digit-7segment-display
A display with 3 digits , controlled by a pic18f2550 microcontroller. 
This is a project for MPLABX IDE

 NOTE:
 Check my youtube channel on how I've connected the 3x 7LED SEGMENT display
 on my microcontroller. I am using a single 8bit SHIFT Register

 NOTE 2:
 I hope that the only thing you need to change is PORTs, LATCHes and TRISes.
 Look in the main.c for "CHANGE THIS".
 Also, deppending on what microcontroller are you using, you might be needing
 to generate your OWN "config.h" configuration file
